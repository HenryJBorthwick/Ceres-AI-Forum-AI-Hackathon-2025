Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) defines famine as 1 in 5 households or more facing starvation, death, extreme lack of food  
Multi-partner initiative that facilitates improved decision making through the provision of consensus-based food security and nutrition analysis. 
Solid evidence: “clear and compelling evidence” of food insecurity, acute malnutrition and mortality 
Founded on a complementary set of analytical tools and procedures  for classifying severity and magnitude of food security and malnutrition. – emphasis on analytical tools, analysis and procedures 
IPC identifies famine conditions, and informs the response needed to save millions of lives. It is the primary mechanism that the international community use to determine if famine happening or not.  
Evidence gathered by wide range of partners. 
5 Stage System: 1. None/Minimal, Stressed (slightly stressed, 5 – 9% malnourished), Crisis (shock to system, eg tsunami or weather event, 10 to 15% malnourished, depleting assets so that your family can eat), 4. Emergency (15-30% malnutrition, extreme depletion of assets, 1-2 deaths/10000people/day, 5. Catastrophe/Famine (malnutrition >30%, 30% households extreme lack of food, 20%households extreme food shortage) complete societal collapsae (exploitation violence 
IPC: facilitate classification, Government role: declaration of famine state 
Common drivers of famine/extreme food crisis: 
Conflict: leads to population displacement, and disrupts traditional methods of logistics 
Weather extremes: drought, flood and cyclones affect food availability 
Economic shocks: such as changing inflation rates, tariffs, disruptions to food trade, and currency volatilities. 
IPC Acute Food Insecurity Scale: to inform decisions on resource allocation and programming locally and within countries, especially those with recurrent or protracted food crises.  
Catrastrophe: Household level classification (even if area-level not in famine), famine: area-level classification (1 in 5 households in catastrophe) 
History: In the last 15 years, 4 famines have been confirmed: Somalia (2011), South Sudan (2017, 2020), Sudan (2024). Caused by severe food shortages, widespread acute malnutrition (conflict and weather patterns) 
Sudan escalating violence -> severely impeded humanitarian access and pushed populations into famien 
Projection: of famine conditions for Palestine (2024), Somalia (2022), Yemen (2018) 
How to avoid and revert famine: 
Early warnings/action: early warning messages should trigger early response to protect livelihoods and save lives. This requires regular monitoring of the drivers of extreme food and nutrition crises. 
Cessation of conflict: “conflict is a key driver of famine conditions. The suspension of active hostilities would allow for the provision of humanitarian assistance.” 
Humanitarian access: full and unimpeded access to establish operations. 
Multisectoral response: Coordinated access to food, agricultural inputs, water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH), health and nutrition 

 

United Nations: Department of Economic and Social Affairs: Sustainable Development 

The 17 Goals: 169 Targets 

Goal 1: (7 Targets): No Poverty: End poverty in all its forms everywhere. 
Goal 2: (8 Targets): Zero Hunger (2nd most important!) End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, promote sustainable agriculture 
Goal 3: Good health and well-being 
SDG Progress Report (2025): 

Global hunger has risen sharply since 2019 and remains high. Nearly 1 in 11 people faced hunger in 2023, while 2b+ experienced moderate to severe food insecurity. 
Hundreds of millions affected by malnutrition 
While the share of countries with high food prices declinedfrom 60 per cent in 2022 to 50 per cent in 2023, this is still more than three times pre-pandemic norms. 
There is a disconnect between investment and sector performance (agricultural investment rising in total but the index decreases over time) 
Getting Goal 2 on track: requires urgent action to strengthen food systems, support small-scale producers, improve services, ensure access to nutritious diets and address structural drivers of food price volatility. 

In 2025, the UN Food Systems Summit and the World Health Assembly (WHA) will help to align global efforts with nationally defined policies. 

“Stubborn hunger trends underscore urgent need for scalable, financed solutions” 

Global hunger levels, measured by the prevalence of undernourishment, remained at the same level for three consecutive years after a sharp rise during the pandemic. In 2023, hunger affected 9.1 per cent of the global population (between 713 and 757 million people), up from 7.5 per cent in2019. Sub-Saharan Africa was the region with the highest hunger rate, with 23.2 per cent of the population facing hunger, while Southern Asia remainedhome to the largest number of people facing hunger, 281 million. 

These persistently high levels of global hunger, food insecurity andmalnutrition are driven by conflict, climate variability and economicinstability, which are further compounded by challenges such as inequalitiesand lack of access to food. Addressing these driving factors – growing in bothintensity and frequency – requires scalable solutions backed by adequateand sustained financing. And now presenting our solution to this problem: _____. X

Connect (30 sec):  

In 2023, hunger affected 10 per cent of the global population, that's around 700 million people. In addition to this, over 2 billion people experienced moderate to severe food insecurity! Hunger and famine are a huge issue still facing the modern world. Team Ceres’s vision is to use Alpha Earth Foundations, Google DeepMind's groundbreaking new geospatial embeddings, to create an interactive platform that better enables analysts to predict famine in major areas. So, what does this mean? 

Problem to solve (1 min):  

The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC for short), is the primary mechanism that the international community (and UN) use to determine if famine is happening or not. How quickly it can be decided whether a famine is occurring or not, determines how quickly aid and investment can be sent to the effected areas. In today’s world, analysts do lofty research and utilize “consensus” based security and food analysis methods, to determine which areas are in the most need. This process is slow, resource intensive, and subject to biases, resulting in unfair distributions of resource. Analysts need a tool that better predicts when famine will occur based on scientific indicators, enabling those people experiencing hunger and famine to get help faster. Hunger is the United Nations second ranked Sustainability Development Goal (SDG) which isn’t on track to achieve it’s 2030 ambitions (fact check). This needs to be addressed. 

Your big idea (2 min):  

To solve this problem, we present Ceres. Ceres leverages Alpha Earth’s new geospatial embeddings, that represent highly accurate and correlated climate data, such as soil moisture, ____ and ____, that have been retrieved from a culmination of new 3D laser mapping technologies. We have trained our own model on this data to find trends, and have presented it in an easily accessible and aesthetic website front end. Users can click through each region, looking at individual statistics, or view a ranking that identifies which regions are most vulnerable and require the most immediate aid.  

(Go deeper into the intimate workings of how the model is trained, how it is unique, discuss new features as they are added) 

(show video or interactive demo) 

Ultimately, analysts will spend less time searching through intense data sets, conferring with peers and trying to find trends among millions of data points using outdated models. Parameters weightings determining the most significant indicators of future famine are easily modifiable so that results can be edited based on United Nations agreed criteria. 

Future impact (1.5 min):  

What do you need: Next steps would be to back test this dataset to improve its accuracy, and train the model on the full data set, including all subregions, to improve accuracies and identify outliers. 

Next steps: The advantage of this model is that the scale resolution can predict down to 100 x 100m areas, allowing analysts to pinpoint the most critical areas for aid. 

Impact: The Ceres innovation will change the way that governments, agencies and non-profit organisations work to organise relief for famines. It will speed up research and discussion, and get humanitarian funding to where it is most needed faster, making it more likely that governments should achieve their 2030 hunger sustainable development goal.
